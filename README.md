# Deep-Learning

- Project 1: Test and compare different network architectures (preferably CNN) with different hyperparameters and data augmentation techniques on a CINIC-10 dataset

- Project 2: Test and compare different network architectures (preferably Transformers) with different hyperparameters on a Speech Commands Dataset

- Project 3: Test and compare different architectures of image generators, with the constraint that at least one of the examined models must be capable of generating satisfactory images. The dataset used for training and testing the models should be the 10% sample of the LSUN Bedrooms Dataset that consists of a number of images of bedrooms
